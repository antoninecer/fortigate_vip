# fortigate_vip

This small python script was made because I cannot find another way how to receive in nice form all port forwarding from fortigate 100d router
This script is very helpfull.
 	firewall_vip.py
create csv from fortigate's save copy part "config firewall vip" - port forwarding

If someone will help me do it dirrectly from original save - it will be nice, because there is more parts which I want take out
for example mac addresses and assigned IP :)

Next 
  dhcp.py 
create csv from fortigate's save copy part "config system dhcp server" - MAC address in DHCP
